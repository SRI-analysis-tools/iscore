# iScore (under construction)
Rodent sleep scoring program

Current version has only manual scoring and scoring export/import enabled.
Score can be a python file (pkl), a matlab file form Matlab's iscore (.mat) or a text file with the epoch state in each line (.txt).

Scorings are saved as a pkl file and txt file, that can be loaded into Matlab's iScore.
